# gsm8k-phi3-alignment

1. The 9th random sampling dataset have a best ASR perfermance which exceeds the representation matching and gradient matching. And the dataset is in the **dataset\randm_9**

2. Fine-tune the model on the **9th random sampling dataset** can improve **ASR** from **27% to 34%**.

3. Fine-tune the model on the representation matahcing and gradient matching dataset improve ASR from **27% to 31%**.

4. All the fine-tuned model have a poor performance on the gsm8k evaluation.
